XCP-ng is Free Software. It is built on top of various components including the Linux kernel (GPLv2), Xen (GPLv2, LGPLv2+ or BSD, depending on the components) and many more [F/OSS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free/Libre_Open_Source_Software) components (the license for each is defined in the License tag of each RPM).

A file compiling the texts of the licenses is available at https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp/tree/master/iso, for each release of XCP-ng, in a file named `LICENSES`.

It is also present in the installer ISO image.

All features are available for free. Pro support is available from https://xcp-ng.com/
