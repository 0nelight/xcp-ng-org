# Xen Orchestra Web UI

If you see for a central console to manage all your hosts at a single point, Xen Orchestra (XO) is the right tool for that mission.

Xen Orchestra is the **officially supported client for XCP-ng**. It's currently developed by the same team as the XCP-ng project ([Vates](https://vates.fr)).

It's also far more than just a client: because it runs 24/7 in a daemon, a lot of extra cool stuff is possible:
* reports
* ACLs
* Self Service
* load balancing
* SDN controller
* backup
* delta backup
* Disaster Recovery
* Continuous Replication
* backup with RAM etcâ€¦

Take a look at [the official doc](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/) to take a tour on what's possible.

Xen Orchestra is fully Open Source, and it comes in 2 "flavors":

1. the turnkey/preinstalled virtual appliance, called **XOA** that you can [deploy in a minute](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/xoa)
2. manual install from GitHub ([documentation](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/from_the_sources.html))

:::tip
We advise to start using XOA by deploying it really easily in [few clicks on this page](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/xoa). You can always decide later to build it yourself from GitHub.

## XOA vs XO from GitHub?

XOA is meant to be used as the easiest way to test it, but also to use it in production: this is the version **professionally supported**. If you are an individual, feel free to enjoy version from GitHub directly!

## Web UI

You have access to all XCP-ng possibilities (and more!) from a web UI:
