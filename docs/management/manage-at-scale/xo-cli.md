# Xen Orchestra CLI

Xen Orchestra CLI or `xo-cli` is a module allowing you to send commands directly from the command line to your Xen Orchestra server.

Check [XO CLI documentation](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/architecture.html#xo-cli-cli).

:::tip
Unlike `xe` which is only connected to one pool, `xo-cli` has access to all pools connected via Xen Orchestra. This is the preferred way to manage your infrastructure, using XO as a central point.
