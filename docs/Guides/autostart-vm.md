# Autostart VM on boot

How to start VM on host boot?

A VM can be started at XCP-ng boot itself, it's called **Auto power on**. We have two ways to configure it: using Xen Orchestra or via the CLI.

## With Xen Orchestra

In Xen Orchestra we can just enable a toggle in VM "Advanced" view, called **Auto power on**. Everything will be set accordingly.

## With the CLI

1. Determine the UUID of the pool for which we want to enable Auto Start. To do this, run the console command on the server:

```
# xe pool-list
uuid ( RO) : <VM_UUID>
```

2. Allow autostart of virtual machines at the pool level with the found UUID command:
`# xe pool-param-set uuid=<VM_UUID> other-config:auto_poweron=true`

Now we enable autostart at the virtual machine level.
3. Execute the command to get the UUID of the virtual machine:

```
# xe vm-list
    uuid ( RO)           : <VM_UUID>
    name-label ( RW)     : VM
    power-state ( RO)    : running
```

4. Enable autostart for each virtual machine with the UUID found:
`# xe vm-param-set uuid=<VM_UUID> other-config:auto_poweron=true`

5. Checking the output
`# xe vm-param-list uuid=<VM_UUID> | grep other-config`
