# Project origin

A long time ago there was the free hypervisor [Xen Cloud Platform - XCP](https://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XCP_Overview) and its commercial version Citrix XenServer. Later Citrix open sourced XenServer, so XCP was no longer needed and discontinued.

But since XenServer 7.3, Citrix removed a lot of features from the free version. The project founder Olivier Lambert wanted to have a free, community based, unrestriced open source hypervisor with the spirit of XCP and so he called his new project `XCP New Generation`, in short XCP-ng.

The goal of XCP-ng is to make a fully community backed version of XenServer, without any feature restrictions.
