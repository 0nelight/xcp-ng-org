# About XCP-ng

## ðŸŒ± The origin

XCP-ng stands as more than a mere product-it's a dynamic project fostered by an engaged community. Originating from the free [Xen Cloud Platform](https://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XCP_Overview) (XCP) and its commercial counterpart, Citrix XenServer, the landscape shifted when Citrix made XenServer open source, leading to the discontinuation of XCP.

However, Citrix's decision to strip several features from the free version of XenServer post-7.3 inspired project founder Olivier Lambert. Aiming to revive the essence of XCP, he initiated "XCP New Generation" or XCP-ng, aspiring to create an unrestricted, community-driven, open source hypervisor, mirroring XenServer's functionality without any feature limitations.

:::tip
XCP-ng was conceived as a friendly fork of XenServer, characterized by an approach that seeks to keep changes to a minimum. Our philosophy is to contribute back to the upstream for all components wherever feasible, maintaining a collaborative and synergistic relationship with the original source.
