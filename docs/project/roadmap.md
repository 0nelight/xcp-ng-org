# Roadmap

Our global roadmap.

The goal of this document is to give you a hint of what's next. However, since all topics are very complex, there's no real order or target date. In general, our priorities are:

* security
* simplicity and flexibility
* performance and scalability

</div>
### Compute

* Xen live patching
* VM storage migration improvement [#145](https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp/issues/145)
* More recent Xen in alternate repo

### Storage

* SMAPIv3 qcow2 export/import
* SMAPIv3 new drivers
* VDI export with compression (including `zstd`)
* SMAPIv3 Ceph support
* Coalesce process improvement (raw speed, rewrite, multicore?) [#127](https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp/issues/127)
* NVMe driver for near bare metal perfs (specification in progress)
* General storage perf improvement
* Thin pro on block based SR (architectural review needed)

### Network

* DPDK support

### API

* XAPI HTTP lib 1.1 replacement (removing stunnel)
* JSON-RPC compression support

### Platform/Installer

* Installer using `ext4` for dom0
* Installer allow join pool directly during install

* Improved provisioning support (Ansible‚Ä¶)
* Automated tests
* new RPM tracking in CentOS (Anitya)
